# Anyone Can Start An Awesome Foundation Chapter

The Awesome Foundation isn't actually a foundation at all. Instead, it's a grassroots movement. Our global community is made up of amazing people who have made the decision to make their local communities a bit more awesome. They organize to assemble, launch, and run their own chapters.

We’re probably biased, but it’s a lot of fun. Chapters have made amazing things happen all around the world, from [building a giant hammock](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/projects/188-the-big-hammock) and [assembling swings in public places](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/projects/2598-swings), to [helping dogs play poker](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/projects/50233-dogs-playing-poker-live) and [letting anyone be Indiana Jones for a day](https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/projects/5071-indiana-jones-and-the-alley-of-doom).

### How do you do it?

Getting a new Awesome Foundation chapter up and running is straightforward – we like keeping things simple.

The biggest task is finding the people who will form the core of your chapter. These “trustees” will be the ones funding grants and deciding who to fund, and you’ll be spending a lot of time with them. Find the most awesome people you can think of and get ‘em on board.

Once you’re ready, we’ll connect you with our global community and give you an account in our application management system, and you’ll have everything you need to run your chapter!

Here are the steps:

1. **Check out existing chapters**: The Awesome Foundation is in a lot of places, so it’s possible that there is already a chapter in your area. Check the “Chapters” menu above to see if there’s one, and get in touch with them if you see one nearby.

2. **Read the New Chapters Handbook**: Awesome Foundation chapters have given out thousands of grants since our humble beginnings in 2009, and we’ve accumulated some wisdom about the best ways of setting up and running a chapter. In fact, [we’ve put together a little handbook for those thinking of starting new chapter](http://wiki.awesomestudies.org/images/9/92/Awesome_Foundation_New_Chapter_Handbook.pdf). Give it a read: it will help you start a chapter in your own community, and answer some questions you might have.

3. **Get in touch**: Send a message to [join@awesomefoundation.org](mailto:join@awesomefoundation.org)! We’ll help you get connected with the global Awesome Foundation community and are happy to answer any questions you might have about getting a chapter up and running.

4. **Assemble your trustees**: Each Awesome Foundation chapter is made up of a group of awesome trustees that each chip in a certain amount of money each month (usually $100 or the local equivalent) to support the monthly grant. You need to find these folks and bring them all together. Once you’ve gotten most of your team together, we’ll add you to our website so you can start accepting grant applications.

5. **Launch**: Great job! You and your chapter are now part of the Awesome Foundation community. Tell everyone about your new chapter and start funding the fantastic, wonderful, and (dare we say) awesome.
